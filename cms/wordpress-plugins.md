# WordPress Plugins

We occasionally need to write our own WordPress plugins, and sometimes want to release them into the WordPress plugin directory.

When doing this, we follow the INN method, [working with release.sh](https://github.com/INN/docs/blob/cb38cf2f12d5abf2ff42919d6fdae68960206c40/projects/wordpress-plugins/release.sh.md). They have thorough documentation about how to use the script. Each plugin should have its own version of `release.sh`, and it should be checked into the git repository.
